Problem statement : Building a code Lock without any microcontroller, using 555 Timer IC based code lock.

Ideation and planning : Understanding the functioning of 555 timer IC in the project as monostable multivibrator and calculator.
LED represents the "Electric Lock" here which remains locked when there is no current and gets unlocked when current passes through it.
Capacitor between PIN6 and ground has a capacitance that determines the turn on time of LED, once a trigger is passed.

Pipeline is as follows :
